<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>"During the Second World War, African American soldiers fought two against two enemies: the Axis forces along the European and Pacific Fronts, and the discrimination and prejudice imposed on them by white commanding officers on the front lines and back home. Soldiers repeatedly had their weapons taken away from them in the field, were banned from officer’s clubs, and were often overlooked for awards or recognition. These injustices formed a second victory that the African American community sought, which was coined a “Double Victory” – a victory for Allied forces, and a victory for racial equality. The struggles and sacrifices of Black soldiers during WWII would change the face of the Civil Rights movement once those soldiers came home." -<em>TheAthenaeumPress</em></p>
