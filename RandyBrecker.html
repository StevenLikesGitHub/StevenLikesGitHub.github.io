Randy Brecker is an influential jazz and funk trumpeter responsible for being one of two leads of the fusion band The Brecker Bros. Starting in the mid-1970s,
Brecker was partly responsible for pushing fusion and the popularity of jazz that made way for entertainers including Richard Elliot, Dave Koz, and David Sanborn's rise
in the 1980s.<br><br>From Wikipedia:<br><br>Brecker was born on November 27, 1945 in the Philadelphia suburb of Cheltenham to a musical family. His father Bob (Bobby) was a lawyer who played jazz piano and his mother Sylvia was a portrait artist.[2] Randy described his father as "a semipro jazz pianist and trumpet fanatic. In school when I was eight, they only offered trumpet or clarinet. I chose trumpet from hearing Diz, Miles, Clifford, and Chet Baker at home. My brother (Michael Brecker) didn't want to play the same instrument as I did, so three years later he chose the clarinet!"[3] Randy's father, Bob, was also a songwriter and singer who loved to listen to recordings of the great jazz trumpet players such as Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and Clifford Brown. He took Randy and his younger brother Michael Brecker to see Davis, Thelonious Monk, Duke Ellington, and many other jazz icons. Brecker attended Cheltenham High School from 1959 to 1963[4] and then Indiana University from 1963 to 1966 studying with Bill Adam, David Baker[5] and Jerry Coker and later moved to New York and performed with Clark Terry's Big Bad Band, the Duke Pearson and the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra.
